% Inputs:
%
%       duration = How long the simulation runs for (sec)
%         peak 1 = The time at which the first rush of students arrives
%         peak 2 = The time at which the second rush of students arrives
%          multi = How many peaks will be used:
%                   0 = just peak 1 (treated as a single binomial
%                   distribution)
%                   1 = both peaks 1 and 2 (treated as bimodal
%                   distribution)
% **Note that the input for peak2 is still required even when it is not
% being used. The value inputted does not impact the output, however.**
%
% Outputs:
%       Matrix T = A matrix whose index is the time (sec) and whose element is
%       whether a student arrives in that given time (there are two
%       options: 1 and 0, which indicate one student arriving and no
%       students arriving respectively) <-- this matrix T is an input
%       needed for queueing.m


% No need to understand this, but this is just ensuring the time frame is
% broken up into seconds
