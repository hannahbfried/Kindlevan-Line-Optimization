In this model, we simulate the queues to purchase food at Kindlevan. We do this by creating various arrival distributions and various two-line constructions, running each pairwise combination (100 times, to account for probabilistic variations), and analyzing the resulting wait times. We look at the performance of each queue structure against all arrival distributions as well as each arrival distribution against all queue structures. With this, we make recommendations for the best queue setup, where we define best by our wait time analysis.

There are four main files: build_arrival_distribution.m, build_customer_matrix.m, build_queues_and_calculate_wait_times.m, and run_simulations.m, where file titles communicate functionality. To run the simulation, press open "run_simulations.m" and press "Run." All relevant data will be stored in cell arrays, indexed by the i, j pairs representing the corresponding arrival distribution and line scenario.
